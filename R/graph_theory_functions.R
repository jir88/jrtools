#' Trim Weighted Graph to k Nearest Neighbors
#'
#' Given an igraph object with weighted edges, this function will create a
#' trimmed igraph with only the k nearest neighbors of each vertex. In this
#' context, nearest neighbors are those with the largest (or smallest)
#' edge weights.
#'
#' @param graph the igraph object to be trimmed
#' @param k the number of neighbors to keep
#' @param method "max" to keep k largest edge weights, "min" to keep the k
#'   smallest edge weights
#' @param edge_mode "out" to consider only outbound edges, "in" to consider only
#'   inbound edges, or "all" to consider both edge types. Ignored for
#'   un-directed graphs.
#' @return a trimmed copy of the input graph
#' @details This is a really simplistic kludge. Use at your own risk!

#' Find connected k-plexes in networks
#'
#' Given an igraph object, this function identifies connected components of
#' induced subgraphs where all N nodes in the component are connected to at
#' least N-k other nodes. Thus, a 1-plex is the same as a clique of size N,
#' because all nodes are connected to each other but not to themselves. A 2-plex
#' is a clique where some nodes are missing at most one edge to another node.
#'
#' WARNING: this method uses an untested algorithm! Use at your own risk! Only
#' works for connected k-plexes! May not find maximal k-plexes or all k-plexes.
#' Requires more formalized testing.
#'
#' @param g the igraph object to search for k-plexes
#' @param min_kc The minimum coreness to consider
#' @param kp the maximum number of missing edges per node in the plex
#' @return a list containing a list of the k-plex graphs, the minimum degrees of
#'   each plex, and the sizes of each plex
#' @details This is a really simplistic kludge. Use at your own risk! May not
#'   behave as intended!

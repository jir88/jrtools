#' Score all possible adduct identities for an MS1 peak
#'
#' Given a peak from an MS1 spectrum, tests how well different adduct assignments
#' match the MS1 spectrum.
#'
#' @param mz The m/z ratio of interest
#' @param mz_polarity The polarity of the m/z ratio. Must be either "positive" or
#'  "negative"
#' @param ms1_spec The MS1 spectrum being examined. Must be tibble-alike with
#'  columns "polarity", "mz", and "intensity"
#' @param all_adducts The possible adducts to be considered. Must be tibble-alike
#'  with columns "polarity", "Ion name", "Power", "Mult", and "Mass".
#' @param ppm_thresh The maximum difference between observed m/z values and
#'  proposed adduct m/z values
#'
#' @return A tibble of adduct candidate match scores.

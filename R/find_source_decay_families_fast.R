#' Simple source decay family search
#'
#' Some compounds fragment when ionized into the gas phase, forming a source
#' decay family. Mass spec features in these families are essentially duplicates
#' of the parent compound and should be identified and treated specially. This
#' function identifies such families based on very similar retention times and
#' correlated peak areas across all samples. This approach also finds instances
#' where the alignment software has missed adducts, isotopologues, or multiply
#' charged versions of a single compound. It also corrects for occasional
#' alignment software errors.
#'
#' @param feature_rts Named numeric vector with retention times for all features.
#'   Names should be unique identifiers for each feature.
#' @param feature_areas Numeric matrix with one column per feature and one row
#'   per sample. Column names must match the names in \code{feature_rts}. Peak areas
#'   should be log-transformed to reduce the extreme skewness typically associated
#'   with mass spec peak intensities.
#' @param drt_max Maximum retention time difference (in minutes) to consider.
#' @param area_cor_min Minimum peak area correlation to consider.
#' @param cor_fun Function to use when calculating correlation. Defaults to
#'   \link[stats]{cor}. Must accept parameters \code{x} and \code{y}.
#' @param ... Other parameters passed to \code{cor_fun}.
#'
#' @details
#' This is a heavily simplified version of \link{find_source_decay_families} that
#' only considers retention time and peak area correlation. It is thus much faster,
#' but also potentially prone to make mistakes. Be sure to check the outputs to
#' ensure that SDF calls seem reasonable for the desired downstream application.

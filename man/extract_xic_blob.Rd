\title{Extract XIC data from an SQLite blob}
\usage{
extract_xic_blob(blb)
}
\arguments{
\item{blb}{A raw vector containing an SQLite blob of XIC data}
}
\value{
A tibble containing the data
}
\description{
Certain mass spec data alignment formats store feature extracted ion
chromatograms as SQLite blobs containing a compressed binary file.
This function extracts the stored data from such blobs.
}
\details{
The precise format of the binary file has not yet been completely elucidated.
Chunk 1 is unknown, but directly related to retention time. Chunk 2 is the
retention time in minutes. Chunk 3 is the XIC itself. Chunk 4 looks like
probably the instantaneous noise level, but might be something else.
